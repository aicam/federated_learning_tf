# federated_learning_tf

TensorFlow Federated (TFF) is an open-source framework for machine learning and other computations 
on decentralized data. Federated Learning (FL), an approach to machine learning where a shared global 
model is trained across many participating clients that keep their training data locally.

In other words, a model that say runs on an edge device at a farm can be trained using data from many
farms, however crucially, each farm does not release their own data, which may be commercially sensitive.

In addition, the programming abstractions we offer are quite generic, and could be used, e.g., to implement 
analytics and other custom types of computations over distributed data.
